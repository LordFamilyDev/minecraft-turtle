To use the update feature, you need a key file named `token` with your personal access token. Learn more about personal access tokens [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).

## Project Structure

### Folders:
All libraries should be under `/lib`. You can update the Lua path by:
```lua
package.path = "/lib/?.lua;;"
```

Then include modules as:
```lua
mod = require("subfolder.modx")
```
Where `.` denotes a folder level.
